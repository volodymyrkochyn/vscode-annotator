## Features

* Display the annotation view (git blame) of the current file.
* Display the diff of a particular commit by selecting a commit hash on the annotation view.
* From the commit diff view, you can:
  * Open the annotation view of the file just before the commit, and trace back the history.
  * Open the diff of another file in the same commit.
* The vertical colour bar is coloured darker for older commits and lighter for more recent commits (or the other way around, depending on the colours you specified).
* Highlight the annotations with same commit hash when hovering over them.
